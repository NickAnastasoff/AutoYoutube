In the dead of night, Sarah heard a strange noise coming from outside her bedroom window. She pulled back her curtains to find an ominous figure, shrouded in darkness, standing in her yard. She could feel the figure's piercing gaze, even from the other side of the window.

Sarah tried to shake off the feeling of dread that had come over her, but the figure remained, still and silent. Finally, she mustered the courage to open her window and demand the figure leave. But when she did, the figure suddenly vanished.

That night Sarah couldn't sleep, feeling that something sinister was lurking in the shadows of her bedroom. She didn't know what it was, but something told her that the figure had returned and was just waiting for the right moment to strike.
